# [fit] What is an autoreloader?

> A component in a larger system that detects and applies changes to source code, without developer interaction.

^ Example: automatically refreshing your browser tab when you change a HTML or JavaScript file

^ I find them interesting: they are very common.

^ A critical part of the framework.

^ not well understood. 

^ very language specific

---

# Hot reloader

A special type of autoreloader that reloads your changes without restarting the system.

Example: Changing the stylesheet of a web page. 

^ No refreshing required, the browser can apply the changes without needing a full reload.

^ The "holy grail" of autoreloaders. Really fast and efficient.

---

# These are impossible to write reliably in Python
 
# **in the general case**.

---

# But Python has `reload()`?

```python
import time
import my_custom_module

while True:
    time.sleep(1)
    reload(my_custom_module)
```

---

# This hot reloads a module

# You need a lot more before it's a **hot reloader**

^ `reload()` does nothing but re-imports the module

^ You need a lot more because...

---

# Dependencies are the enemy of an autoreloader

## Python modules have *lots* of inter-dependencies

^ All hot reloaders utilize language or framework features that manage dependencies between things.

^ CSS is declarative: no dependencies, can be safely re-applied

^ Erlang: everything uses message passing.

^ JavaScript: Frameworks and bundlers do great jobs of tracking dependencies, and the browser takes care of a lot of 
  the reloading.

---

# How would you handle `AClass.a_function` being deleted?

```python
from module import MyClass

function = MyClass.my_function

def another_method():
   function()
```

^ Imagine you remove `my_function`

^ If the `function` variable references old code then your hot reloader doesn't work

^ So you need to find all modules that reference `my_function` and reload them as well

^ Then you need to cascade, because other modules might depend on this one.

^ It gets really complex really fast, and you definitely don't want bugs that only appear randomly in development 
  because your hot reloader didn't quite work properly. 

^ For limited, smaller cases it may work - you can easily update a single reference to an object.

---

# So how do we reload code in Python?

^ I'm glad you asked

---

# [fit] We turn it off and on again

![inline](./images/on-off.jpg)

---

# We restart the process.

# On every code change.

# Over and over again.

^ Kind of like refreshing a browser window.

^ You loose all state in the process, and it starts again from fresh

---

[.build-lists: true]

# [fit] When you start the Django development server:

1. Django re-executes the server with a specific  environment variable set

2. The child process runs Django and watches for any file changes

3. When a change is detected it exits with a specific exit code (3)

4. The parent Django process restarts it.

^ So it's a simple loop: You have a process that's a supervisor, and it will restart the child process when it exits

^ This is the most common, and simplest, form of an autoreloader.

---

# The history of the Django autoreloader

First commit in 2005

No major changes until 2013 when `inotify` support was added

`kqueue` support was also added in 2013, then removed 1 month later

^ Django code is generally quite high quality, with a lot of emphasis on testing and readability.

^ Old, crufty part of Django

^ The code was not idiomatic and hard to extend.

^ append-only code. 

^ Some new features would be very hard to add without refactoring.

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Summary so far:

1. An autoreloader is a common development tool

2. Hot reloaders are really hard to write in Python

3. Python autoreloaders restart the process on code changes

4. The Django autoreloader was old and hard to extend

---

# (Re-)Building an autoreloader

[.build-lists: true]

Three or four steps:

1. Find files to monitor

2. Monitor files and trigger a reload

3. Make it testable

4. Bonus points: Make it efficient

---

# Finding files to monitor

`sys.modules`

```
‚ùØ ipython -c 'import sys; print(len(sys.modules))'
642
```

^ sys.modules contains all the Python modules currently loaded, 

^ maps names to the modules

^ lots of modules. 

^ When you run `ipython` we have nearly 650 modules loaded.

```
‚ùØ python -c 'import sys; print(len(sys.modules))'
42
```

---

# Finding files to monitor

Sometimes things that are *not* modules find their way inside `sys.modules`

```
‚ùØ ipython -c 'import sys; print(sys.modules["typing.io"])'
<class 'typing.io'>
```

^ You kind of expect sys.modules to contain only modules

^ sys.modules can be mutated by Python code.

^ Some libraries do crazy things!

---

# Python's imports are very dynamic

The import system is unbelievably flexible

Can import from `.zip` files, or from `.pyc` files directly

[https://github.com/nvbn/import\_from\_github\_com](https://github.com/nvbn/import_from_github_com)

```python
from github_com.kennethreitz import requests
```

^ 60 lines of code!

^ Can write a 'loader' to do magic things to imports

^ Other more common uses: pytest, Cython

^ Two different modules can share the same file, or have no file at all.

^ There isn't always a mapping between a module and an actual, unique file.

---

# What can you do?

![inline](images/shrug.gif)

^ So what can we do if someone wants to import code directly from Github?

^ So the point here is: Python imports are very dynamic

^ not all changes can be detected.

^ we can make a best effort

---

# Finding files: The simplest implementation

```python
import sys

def get_files_to_watch():
    return [
        module.__spec__.origin
        for module in sys.modules.values()
    ]
```

^ Each module has a `__spec__`, and that object has an `origin`. Lots of exclusions to this, like I said before.

^ All of these code samples are really simplistic - the Django implementation for this is over 40 lines long.

^ This is conceptually what we want to do.

---

# (Re-)Building an autoreloader

Three or four steps:

1. ~~Find files to monitor~~

2. Monitor files and trigger a reload

3. Make it testable

4. Bonus points: Make it efficient

---

# Waiting for changes

All[^1] filesystems report the last modification of a file

```python
mtime = os.stat('/etc/password').st_mtime
print(mtime)
1561338330.0561554
```

^ We can use this to detect when a file has been changed

^ The last modification time can mean different things to different OS's and platforms.

[^1]: Except when they don't

---

# Filesystems can be _weird_.

^ current time within the Linux kernel is cached. Typically it's updated around 10ms.

^ Python does a great job at abstracting most platform-specific things away. 

^ You cannot really escape from the filesystem.

^ Case in point: macOS has a case-insensitive filesystem by default.
  
HFS+: 1 second time resolution

Windows: 100ms intervals (edits may appear in the future :scream:)

Linux: Depends on your hardware clock!

```python
p = pathlib.Path('test')
p.touch()
time.sleep(0.005) # Wait 5 milliseconds
p.touch() # Will not register
```

---

# Filesystems can be _weird_.

Network filesystems mess things up completely

^ Network filesystems may be very slow: a `stat()` call might require network access!

^ The clocks may be out of sync

`os.stat()` suddenly becomes expensive!

^ The time can be set by anything

^ It does not always mean there is a change

^ Reason for use: easy to implement, generally efficient and pretty good cross platform support

# Watching files: A simple implementation

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 4]
[.code-highlight: 5-6]
[.code-highlight: 7-8]
[.code-highlight: 9-11]

```python
import time, os

def watch_files():
    file_times = {} # Maps paths to last modified times
    while True:
        for path in get_files_to_watch():
            mtime = os.stat(path).st_mtime
            previous_mtime = file_times.setdefault(path, mtime)
            if mtime != previous_mtime:
                exit(3)  # Change detected!
        time.sleep(1)
```

# (Re-)Building an autoreloader

Three or four steps:

2. ~~Monitor files and trigger a reload~~

3. Make it testable

# Making it testable

Not many tests in the wider ecosystem

| Project | Test Count |
| --- | :---: |
| Tornado | 2 |
| Flask | 3 |
| Pyramid | 6 |

^ Mostly these are high level integration tests. They spawn a server, change a file and check if the server exited.

^ Obviously these all work quite well

^ not shaming these projects

^ hard thing to test

---

# Making it testable

Reloaders are infinite loops that run in threads and rely on a big ball of external state.

^ Each of these things is hard to test by themselves, but when you combine them it gets even harder.

^ How do we make these testable?

---

# Generators!

^ A generator lets you suspend and resume execution

---

# Generators!

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 1, 9]
[.code-highlight: 10]

```python
def watch_files(sleep_time=1):
    file_times = {}
    while True:
        for path in get_files_to_watch():
            mtime = os.stat(path).st_mtime
            previous_mtime = file_times.setdefault(path, mtime)
            if mtime > previous_mtime:
                exit(3)
        time.sleep(sleep_time)
        yield
```

^ add a sleep time parameter

^ add a yield

^ lets you write slightly better tests

---

# Generators!

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 2]

```python
def test_it_works(tmp_path):
    reloader = watch_files(sleep_time=0)
    next(reloader)  # Initial tick
    increment_file_mtime(tmp_path)
    with pytest.raises(SystemExit):
       next(reloader)
```

^ we have a way to pause our autoloader, make changes to the filesystem, and resume it.

^ You can test this with symbolic links, permission errors, files being intermittently available

# Making it efficient

Slow parts: 

1. Iterating modules

2. Checking for file modifications

---

# Making it efficient: Iterating modules

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 3-4]
[.code-highlight: 6-8]

```python
import sys, functools

def get_files_to_watch():
    return sys_modules_files(frozenset(sys.modules.values()))

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def sys_modules_files(modules):
    return [module.__spec__.origin for module in modules]
```

^ `sys.modules` doesn't often change after starting

^ In the real world we need a non-trivial amount of processing. 
  
^ We can use `lru_cache` to skip needlessly re-processing the modules list.

---

# Making it efficient: Filesystem notifications

^ calling stat repeatedly is wasteful. 

^ OS's have built in support for filesystem notifications.

^ The OS tells you when a change is made

---

# Making it efficient: Filesystem notifications

Each platform has different ways of handling this

Watchdog[^2] implements 5 different ways - 3,000 LOC!

^ Notifiers are potentially expensive

^ designed for longer-term monitoring. 

^ we create and destroy them quickly.

They are all *directory* based.

^ Directory based watching is complex

^ get all changes, including non python ones.

# Making it efficient: Filesystem notifications

![inline](./images/watchman.png)

https://facebook.github.io/watchman/

^ Watchman is a daemon that handles this all for you.

^ runs in background, you register watches with it, and it handles the nitty gritty.

^ Adding support for this was actually the reason I started working on refactoring the autoreloader in the first place.

^ Handles git changes!

^ daemon can be shared with other projects

---

# Making it efficient: Filesystem notifications

[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 4-6]
[.code-highlight: 8-10]

```python
import watchman

def watch_files(sleep_time=1):
    server = watchman.connect_to_server()
    for path in get_files_to_watch():
        server.watch_file(path)
    while True:
        changes = server.wait(timeout=sleep_time)
        if changes:
            exit(3)
        yield
```

^ this is pseudo-code

^ we wait for the server to send us changes

^ we don't write any platform specific code

---

# (Re-)Building an autoreloader

1. ~~Find files to monitor~~

2. ~~Wait for changes and trigger a reload~~

3. ~~Make it testable~~

4. ~~Bonus points: Make it efficient~~

---

# The aftermath

* Much more modern, easy to extend code :heavy_check_mark:
* Faster, and can use Watchman if available :heavy_check_mark:
* Well tested :heavy_check_mark:
* No longer a "dark corner" of Django[^3] :heavy_check_mark:

[^3]: I might be biased!

^ So all good, right? 

^ I'm a genius and it worked first time

^ tests green, ship it?

^ everyone is happy?

^ Issue in bottom left is due to files in Windows appearing in the future

---

# Conclusions:

## Don't write your own autoloader.

---

# Use the `hupper` library:

## https://github.com/Pylons/hupper

```python
import hupper
reloader = hupper.start_reloader('your.module.main')

# monitor an extra file
reloader.watch_files(['foo.ini'])
```

## Works with Watchdog, watchman, native system events, polling, etc.
